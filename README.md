Partnered project where the class game “space invaders” is re-created to high-light object interaction, GUI development, Interface design, and user driven events. 
Game is written in java, using the Eclipse IDE.
Java Awt and Swing libraries were used for the GUI and for handling user events. 
In this project I wrote the classes responsible for drawing the graphics, events handling, internal game logic, and object interaction.
